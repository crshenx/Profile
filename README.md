## Work Experience

- Graduated from Flatiron School's software engineering bootcamp, where I learned how to build full-stack web applications using Ruby on Rails, React, and other modern technologies. Currently I am self-employed at plus2creative as a full stack software engineer implementing solutions to grow our business.
